// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

input integer
if remainder = 0 answer = even
if remainder not equal to 0 answer = odd
output answer

Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


input 5 integers
calculate average
calculate minimum
calculate maximum
print "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
print "The smallest number entered is: " + minimum
print "The largest number entered is: " + maximum
